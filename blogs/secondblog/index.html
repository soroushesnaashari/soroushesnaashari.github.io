            <p>
                As someone with a background in industrial engineering, I had always been attracted by solving complex
                problems and searching for the way to enhance the efficiency of systems. When I, about a year ago for
                the first time, started exploring machine learning, I knew it was a powerful tool with enormous
                potential, though at that time, I did not realize fully how it would expand my perspective. It has been
                an exciting journey, challenging and full of unexpected lessons. In this post, I&apos;ll share a bit
                about
                what I&apos;ve learned and some surprises that came along the way.
            </p>

            <h3>Finding a New Kind of Problem-Solving</h3>
            <p>
                In industrial engineering, we&apos;re often taught to look at systems and find ways to make them more
                effective. Machine learning introduced me to a different type of problem-solving: training models on
                data to find patterns or predict outcomes without needing to program the ”rules” ourselves. This concept
                felt completely different from traditional approaches, and it opened up a lot of possibilities that I
                hadn&apos;t considered before.<br>

                The transition wasn&apos;t always easy, though. I found that machine learning requires a balance of
                technical
                skill and experimentation. Understanding how to work with algorithms and data was one thing, but tuning
                models and interpreting results, required patience and persistence. I learned quickly that machine
                learning is not a “one-size-fits-all” approach.


            </p>

            <h3>The Power of Data—and the Challenges It Brings</h3>
            <p>
                Another eye-opening aspect of machine learning was how much the quality of data mattered. In traditional
                engineering projects, we work with precise measurements and detailed plans; Machine learning relies so
                extensively on data that, until relatively recently, I came to realize how messy or incomplete data
                might affect results. There&apos;s an entire process to handling data: cleaning it, preprocessing it and
                sometimes collecting more. This was both a challenge and a lesson, because it proved that data is the
                backbone of success in machine learning models.<br>

                Working with data also taught me about the importance of metrics and evaluation. I came to realize that
                accuracy alone doesn&apos;t always tell the full story, especially on complex models. Evaluation metrics
                like
                F1-score became critical tools to ensure that my models wouldn&apos;t just stop at accurate predictions
                but
                meaningful ones.
            </p>

            <h3>Building a “Growth Mindset” in Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>
                Perhaps one of the biggest surprises for me was the mindset shift that machine learning encouraged. This
                field moves fast: new tools, frameworks, and techniques are constantly emerging. At first, it was
                overwhelming, but I came to accept this fast pace as part of the learning process. Adopting a “growth
                mindset” has been key for me. I&apos;ve learned to see each challenge as an opportunity to build new
                skills
                and deepen my understanding.<br>

                Learning machine learning has taught me that it&apos;s okay to be a beginner again. Every project has
                its own
                learning curve, and even the mistakes I made taught me something valuable. Building this mindset has not
                only helped me with machine learning but also in approaching challenges in other areas of my work.
            </p>

            <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
            <p>
                My journey in machine learning is just beginning, but already it&apos;s broadened my view of what&apos;s
                possible
                and equipped me with skills which I never anticipated. The more I explore machine learning, the more I
                look forward to see how to apply these techniques in solving real-world problems.
