            <p>
                Hello, and welcome to my World!<br>
                <br>
                I&apos;m so glad you&apos;re here. This blog marks the start of something I&apos;ve wanted to create for
                a long time—a
                space to connect, share, and explore. In a way, this is my online home, a place where I can introduce
                myself and give you a glimpse of what am I doing.<br>

                Outside of my work, I love exploring new ideas, whether it&apos;s diving into a great music, tackling a
                new
                skill, or simply taking a walk and letting my mind wander. I think there&apos;s so much we can learn by
                looking at the world with an open mind. This sense of curiosity has brought me to many interesting
                places, and it&apos;s what inspires me to keep growing.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Start This Blog?</h3>
            <p>
                Creating this blog is my way of welcoming you into my world, sharing a bit of myself, and inviting you
                to join me on this journey. I wanted to create a place that feels friendly and open, where we can talk
                about anything that comes to mind—ideas, experiences, challenges, and all the little things that make
                life interesting.<br>

                This isn&apos;t just a place to read; it&apos;s a space where I hope you&apos;ll feel comfortable, where
                we can connect
                through shared ideas and a love for exploring. Maybe you&apos;ll find a bit of inspiration here, or
                maybe
                just a story that resonates. Either way, I hope you feel welcome.
            </p>

            <h3>What You Can Expect Here</h3>
            <p>
                This blog will be a mix of things—personal reflections, stories from my journey, and thoughts on
                what&apos;s
                shaping my world.<br>

                Professionally, I&apos;m an industrial engineer with a deep interest in AI, Machine Learning, Deep
                Learning,
                and Data Science. My background has given me a strong foundation in problem-solving, optimization and
                efficiency, and my journey has led me to explore how technology and data can drive smarter decisions and
                innovative solutions. I&apos;m passionate about the ways that data science and AI are transforming
                industries
                and helping us understand patterns and possibilities in ways we never could before.<br>

                Of course, I&apos;m also a huge sports enthusiast, which you can know about them more on Hobbies page,
                so you
                may see a few posts where I connect my professional interests to sports—or simply share my excitement
                for a big game!
            </p>

            <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
            <p>
                Thank you for stopping by! I&apos;m excited to share this journey with you and to see where it leads.
                This is
                just the beginning, and I&apos;m looking forward to exploring, learning, and growing together.<br>
                <br>
                Here&apos;s to the journey ahead—into the world of Soroush and beyond!
