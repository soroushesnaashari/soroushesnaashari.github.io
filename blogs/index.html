            <li>Beyond the Basics, Exploring RobustScaler, MaxAbsScaler and Other Scaling Methods (Dec 2024)</li>
            <p>
                In this article, I dive into advanced scaling
                techniques that go beyond traditional methods like StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler. The article
                highlights <span style="font-weight: 600;">RobustScaler</span>, which uses median and interquartile
                range to handle outliers effectively, and
                <span style="font-weight: 600;">MaxAbsScaler</span>, perfect for sparse data as it preserves zero
                entries. It also explores additional methods
                like <span style="font-weight: 600;">QuantileTransformer</span> and <span
                    style="font-weight: 600;">PowerTransformer</span>, which offer solutions for non-linear scaling and
                variance
                stabilization. This comprehensive guide helps data scientists choose the right scaler for complex
                datasets, boosting model accuracy and robustness.<br>

            <li>StandardScaler vs MinMaxScaler (Dec 2024)</li>
            <p>Data scaling is a key preprocessing step in machine learning that transforms data into a consistent
                range, boosting model performance and interpretability. The article highlights two widely used
                techniques: <span style="font-weight: 600;">StandardScaler</span> and <span
                    style="font-weight: 600;">MinMaxScaler</span>. StandardScaler adjusts data to have a mean of 0 and a
                standard deviation of 1, making it perfect for normally distributed data by eliminating bias and
                ensuring balance. Conversely, MinMaxScaler scales data to a fixed range (typically 0 to 1), maintaining
                proportional relationships and excelling with bounded or non-normal data.<br>

            <li>How Was My First Steps in Machine Learning: Lessons and Surprises (Oct 2024)</li>
            <p>As someone with a background in industrial engineering, I had always been attracted by solving complex
                problems and searching for the way to enhance the efficiency of systems. When I, about a year ago for
                the first time, started exploring machine learning, I knew it was a powerful tool with enormous
                potential, though at that time, I did not realize fully how it would expand my perspective. It has been
                an exciting journey, challenging and full of unexpected lessons. In this post, I&apos;ll share a bit
                about
                what I&apos;ve learned and some surprises that came along the way.<br>

            <li>A Journey into the World of Soroush and Beyond! (Sep 2024)</li>
            <p>Hello, and welcome to my World!
                I&apos;m so glad you&apos;re here. This blog marks the start of something I&apos;ve wanted to create for
                a long time—a space to connect, share, and explore. In a way, this is my online home, a place where I
                can introduce myself and give you a glimpse of what am I doing.<br>
