        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            Beyond my professional work in AI and engineering, I have several hobbies and interests that help me 
            maintain a balanced perspective and fuel my creativity.
        </p>

        <h3>Philosophical Exploration</h3>
        <p>
            I enjoy diving deep into philosophical questions about consciousness, artificial intelligence, and the 
            nature of reality. These explorations often lead to interesting insights that I can apply to my technical work.
        </p>

        <h3>Reading and Research</h3>
        <p>
            I'm an avid reader, particularly interested in books about technology, science, philosophy, and the 
            future of human civilization. I believe continuous learning is essential for staying relevant in the 
            rapidly evolving field of AI.
        </p>

        <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
        <p>
            I enjoy tackling complex problems, whether they're mathematical puzzles, coding challenges, or 
            real-world optimization problems. This hobby directly complements my professional work and helps me 
            develop better analytical skills.
        </p>

        <h3>Technology Exploration</h3>
        <p>
            I love experimenting with new technologies, frameworks, and tools. This includes exploring emerging 
            AI models, testing new programming languages, and understanding how different technologies can be 
            integrated to solve complex problems.
        </p>

        <h3>Strategic Thinking</h3>
        <p>
            I enjoy games and activities that require strategic thinking, such as chess, strategic board games, 
            and complex puzzle games. These activities help me develop better planning and decision-making skills.
