        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I’m Soroush, an Industrial Engineer, with a strong foundation in Mathematics, Management, Analytical Thinking 
            and Problem Solving who studied at the Islamic Azad University Central Tehran Branch.
        </p>

        <p>
            My academic journey culminated in a thesis on AI and its applications in industrial engineering, 
            where I had the chance to explore various topics under the supervision of Prof. Parisa Shahnazari-Shahrezaei. 
            This experience deepened my passion for Artificial Intelligence and inspired me to see how AI and it's tools 
            can transform traditional engineering practices.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the last two years of my studies, I spent countless hours researching about some related and new fields 
            like Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science. I was excited to blend these cutting-edge areas with 
            my foundation in Industrial Engineering. I’m especially interested in how AI and data-driven strategies can 
            unlock new efficiencies and insights. Whether analyzing complex systems or working on innovative AI solutions, 
            I enjoy the challenge of turning data into decisions that make a real impact.
        </p>

        <p>
            With experience in project management, data science, machine learning and applied analysis, I thrive in environments that allow 
            me to tackle new challenges and continuously expand my skill set. I’m especially excited about exploring 
            new fields like Natural Language Processing (NLP) which open up even more possibilities for innovative and data-driven solutions.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            I look forward to continue my journey as energetic as possible. Let’s dive into the endless world of learning!
