        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I’m Soroush, an Industrial Engineer with a solid foundation in mathematics, management, analytical thinking 
            and problem solving. I studied at the Islamic Azad University, Central Tehran Branch. My academic journey culminated 
            in a thesis on AI and its applications in industrial engineering, where I had the chance to explore various topics under the supervision of 
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/parisa-shahnazari-shahrezaei-31854042/" class="active">Prof. Parisa Shahnazari-Shahrezaei</a>. 
            That project deepened my passion for Artificial Intelligence and showed me how AI and its tools can transform 
            traditional engineering practices.
        </p>

        <p>
            During the last two years of university I dove into programming and the fundamentals of AI, and I started doing 
            hands-on projects to put theory into practice. After graduation I kept learning, tackling more complex concepts 
            (such as Deep Learning and Neural Networks) and building real systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today I work in industry as a Data Crawler and Web Scraper, a role that’s given me practical experience with data 
            pipelines and large-scale information collection and pushed me further toward the fields I want to grow in: 
            Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs).
        </p>

        <p>
            As I mentioned I’m really passionate about AI and I love transforming messy data into useful products and insights. 
            My Industrial Engineering background gives me an engineering mindset and a set of practical soft skills, 
            systems thinking, process optimization, project management and clear cross-team communication, that shape 
            how I design and deliver AI solutions. Those skills help me keep models useful, scalable and aligned with 
            real-world needs.
        </p>

        <p>
            With experience across project management, data science, machine learning, applied analysis and web-scale 
            data collection, I enjoy tackling hard problems and shipping solutions that actually help people and teams.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I look forward to continue my journey as energetic as possible. Let’s dive into the endless world of learning!
        </p>
