        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I am Mohammad Soroush Esnaashari, an Industrial Engineer with a deep passion for artificial intelligence, 
            machine learning, deep learning, and data science. My journey in engineering has given me a unique perspective 
            on how to apply AI technologies to solve real-world industrial problems efficiently and effectively.
        </p>

        <p>
            My background in industrial engineering has taught me to think systematically about processes, optimization, 
            and efficiency. This foundation, combined with my expertise in AI and machine learning, allows me to approach 
            complex problems with both analytical rigor and innovative thinking.
        </p>

        <p>
            I believe that the future of industry lies in the intelligent integration of AI technologies with traditional 
            engineering principles. My goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical AI advancements and practical industrial 
            applications, creating solutions that are not only technologically advanced but also economically viable and 
            operationally efficient.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I'm not working on AI projects or exploring new technologies, I enjoy diving into thought-provoking 
            questions about consciousness, technology, and the future of human-machine interaction. These philosophical 
            explorations often inspire new approaches to technical problems.
        </p>
